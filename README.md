# Depths
<sup>(placeholder name)</sup>

*Gather your party or go it alone and venture into the catacombs of Mount Rahapni, where dark demons dwell and restless spirits stand guard. Find fame and fortune if you can, and try not to fall prey to the keepers of the depths.*

Depths is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler, with permadeath, procedurally generated levels and local cooperative play. 
It's currently using placeholder OpenGameArt graphics by [Buch](http://opengameart.org/users/buch) and [Sharm](http://opengameart.org/users/sharm), 
and placeholder music by [Tanner Helland](http://www.tannerhelland.com/18/from-here/).
